0.  It's The longest possible word in the ENglish language that's why length is equal 45. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, it is "an artificial long word said to mean a lung disease caused by inhaling very fine ash and sand dust.
1.  getrusage() returns resource usage measures for who, which can be one of the following:
RUSAGE_SELF
Return resource usage statistics for the calling process, which is the sum of resources used by all threads in the process.
RUSAGE_CHILDREN
Return resource usage statistics for all children of the calling process that have terminated and been waited for.
 These statistics will include the resources used by grandchildren, and further removed descendants,
  if all of the intervening descendants waited on their terminated children.
2.  The rusage struct stores 16 sets of data.
rusage definition
struct rusage {
    struct timeval ru_utime; /* user CPU time used */
    struct timeval ru_stime; /* system CPU time used */
    long   ru_maxrss;        /* maximum resident set size */
    long   ru_ixrss;         /* integral shared memory size */

};
3.  It save us memory because we dont have to make a copies before and after variables,  and you cannot place value into prototype because it needs pointer 
4.  First program checks if it is able to open a text file. If yes, by for loop it reads character by character because of fgetc, until end of file appear 
and  checks if character is only alphabetical or it's apostroph. If yes, add char to a word. A program ignore digit numbers and too long alphabetical strings 
where length is more than 45. Ignore is make by while loop and set array of variable word to 0. The program will check, spelling, time of process 
record count of found word reset the index of the next word.  This procces will continue by last word will have found. 
5.  fgetc read word character by character, and accept only alphapetical characters or apostrophes. Fscans can store for example sign coma in an array and it can cause problems with misspelling
6.  Because these values shouldn't be modified during the checking process and const quarantee that these parameters ane not modifable. 
7.  Create a hastable to separate words lesss than 46 letters into a linked list. Node contains a words with Lenght less than 46 and in addition pounter to a next node.
8.  I don't remember because the problem was segmentation fault and if code started to work it was a similar score to a current verison.
9.  after working version probably nothing.
10. I'm not sure about optimal value of hashtable size.
